# Diploma Project - Database Setup with Drizzle ORM

This project uses Drizzle ORM with SQLite to manage the database. Below are instructions on how to set up and use the database.

## Database Structure

The database includes the following tables:

1. **Employees** - Stores information about employees
   - id (primary key)
   - name
   - email
   - position
   - department
   - joinDate
   - status 

2. **Companies** - Stores information about companies
   - id (primary key)
   - name
   - contact
   - email
   - phone
   - projects
   - address
   - notes

3. **Clients** - Stores a list of client names
   - id (primary key)
   - name

4. **Reports** - Stores time tracking reports
   - id (primary key)
   - employeeId (foreign key to employees)
   - date
   - market
   - contractingAgency
   - client
   - projectBrand
   - media
   - jobType
   - comments
   - hours

5. **Reports to Companies** - Junction table linking reports and companies (many-to-many)
   - id (primary key)
   - reportId (foreign key to reports)
   - companyId (foreign key to companies)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Database Setup

1. Generate database migrations based on the schema:
   ```
   npm run db:generate
   ```

2. Initialize the database:
   ```
   npm run db:init
   ```

3. Seed the database with initial data:
   ```
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. (Optional) View and modify the database using Drizzle Studio:
   ```
   npm run db:studio
   ```

## Database Usage in Code

To use the database in your components or API routes, import the query functions from the `db/queries.ts` file:

```typescript
import { employeeQueries, companyQueries, clientQueries, reportQueries } from '../db/queries';

// Example: Get all employees
const employees = await employeeQueries.getAll();

// Example: Add a new employee
const newEmployee = await employeeQueries.add({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  position: "Developer",
  department: "Engineering",
  joinDate: "01.05.2023",
  status: "Active"
});

// Example: Get reports with employee information
const reports = await reportQueries.getAllWithEmployee();
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the project for production
- `npm run start` - Start the production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate database migrations
- `npm run db:push` - Push schema changes to the database
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio to view and modify the database
- `npm run db:init` - Initialize the database
- `npm run db:seed` - Seed the database with initial data

## User Report Management

### User-Specific Reports

All reports created by a user are automatically associated with that user's employee record in the database. The application ensures that:

1. When a user creates a new report, it is saved with their employee ID
2. Users can only view, edit, and delete their own reports
3. Admins can view reports from all users

### How It Works

The application uses Clerk for authentication and maintains a relationship between Clerk user IDs and employee records in the database:

1. When a user creates a report through the calendar interface, the system:
   - Identifies the current user via Clerk authentication
   - Finds the corresponding employee record
   - Associates the report with that employee's ID

2. The report data is stored in the database with the following structure:
   - Basic report information (date, hours, comments, etc.)
   - Reference to the employee who created it
   - Associated companies (client and contracting agency)

3. API Endpoints:
   - `GET /api/reports` - Retrieves all reports for the current user
   - `POST /api/reports` - Creates a new report for the current user
   - `PUT /api/reports` - Updates an existing report (only if it belongs to the current user)
   - `DELETE /api/reports?id={reportId}` - Deletes a report (only if it belongs to the current user)

This security model ensures that users can only access and modify their own data while administrators maintain oversight capabilities for the entire system.

## Internationalization (i18n)

This project uses **i18next** with the **HTTP backend** (`i18next-http-backend`) and **react-i18next** for loading and using translations.

1. Translation files
   - Place your JSON translation files under `public/locales/{lng}/translation.json`. For example:
     - `public/locales/en/translation.json`
       ```json
       {
         "welcome": "Welcome",
         "dashboard": "Dashboard"
       }
       ```
     - `public/locales/de/translation.json`
       ```json
       {
         "welcome": "Willkommen",
         "dashboard": "Instrumententafel"
       }
       ```

2. Adding new keys
   - Open the appropriate `translation.json` for your language and add new key/value pairs.

3. Using translations in React
   - In any client component, import and use the `useTranslation` hook:
     ```tsx
     import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

     export default function MyComponent() {
       const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();
       return <h1>{t('welcome')}</h1>;
     }
     ```

4. Changing languages at runtime
   - You can switch languages programmatically:
     ```ts
     i18n.changeLanguage('de');
     ```

5. Debugging
   - During development (`NODE_ENV=development`), i18next will log events to the console to help diagnose issues.
